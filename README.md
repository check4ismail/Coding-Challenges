# Coding-Challenges

Solving daily coding challenges using Swift. 

Coding challenges can either come from Cracking the Coding Interview or from GeekforGeeks.

At the very top of the Swift file, the coding challenge description will always be included via comments.

## Pre-requesites to run Swift files via Terminal
Run the following command in your terminal
```
xcode-select --install
```

## Running Swift file(s)
To run a Swift file, enter the following command in Terminal:
```
swift <fileName>.swift
```

Some coding challenges may require more than one Swift file to run (because of requiring a data structure/algorithm). In those cases, you'll see the command embedded in the coding challenge comments in order to successfully run it. Something like this:
```
/*
  To run program, enter the following commands:
  - command1
  - command2
  etc.
*/
```
